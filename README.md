## 🛠️ Technologies Used 

 - **HTML**: Markup language for structuring the content.
- **CSS**: Styling language used for layout and design.
  - **CSS Variables**: For managing colors, sizes, and transitions.
  - **Flexbox**: For flexible and responsive layouts.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic behavior and interactivity.
  - **Event Handling**: To manage user interactions with the cards and radio buttons.


## 🛠️ Installation

2. **Navigate to the project directory**.
3. **Open the Project**:

  Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser to view the project.


## 📖 Approach 

1. **Design and Layout**:
   - **CSS Variables**: Defined for primary and secondary colors, font sizes, border radius, and shadows. This ensures consistency across the design and easy updates.
   - **Flexbox Layouts**: Used for aligning items within cards and the container to ensure responsive and adaptive designs.

2. **Card Interactions**:
   - **JavaScript Event Listeners**: Added to handle click events on cards. The click event toggles the visibility of card content and manages the state of associated radio buttons.
   - **Card Content Toggle**: When a card is clicked, it opens or closes its content, while ensuring other cards' content is closed. This is achieved by iterating through all cards and updating their states.

3. **Styling**:
   - **Hover Effects**: Applied to cards to provide visual feedback using shadows.
   - **Card Header**: Styled to include a discount badge and radio button area with responsive layouts.
   - **Radio Buttons**: Custom styled to fit the design and provide interactive feedback when selected.
